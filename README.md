# 🛡️ SentinelAI: Adaptive Malicious Insider Threat Detection

An end-to-end **cybersecurity research framework and data pipeline** designed to detect and respond to **adaptive insider threats** using a **Bayesian Stackelberg Game**.

Unlike traditional anomaly detection systems that rely on fixed behavioral patterns, SentinelAI models how attackers can change their behavior to avoid detection. It combines **Game Theory, Explainable AI (XAI), and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** to create an adaptive and secure threat detection environment.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional insider threat detection often relies on fixed behavioral patterns, but attackers can **change their tactics to avoid detection**.

SentinelAI models the attacker-defender interaction as a **dynamic Stackelberg Game** using **RASRO (Risk-Adaptive Security Response Optimization)**. It uses historical interactions, attacker adaptation, and defense effectiveness to select appropriate security responses.

> **Adaptive insider threat detection using Game Theory, Explainable AI, and Post-Quantum Cryptography.**

---

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. 🎮 Dynamic Stackelberg Game Engine — RASRO

- Models the **SOC as the Leader** and the **Insider as the Follower** across multiple interactions.
- Uses PostgreSQL history to track changing attacker behavior.
- Calculates **AAS (Attacker Adaptation Score)** and **RES (Response Effectiveness Score)**.
- Supports adaptive mitigation actions such as `REVOKE_SESSION` and `RESTRICT_ACCESS`.

### 2. 🤖 Explainable AI (XAI)

- Uses **Isolation Forest** and **One-Class SVM** to detect unusual user behavior.
- Analyzes signals such as data transfer, login times, and sensitive file access.
- Uses **Tree SHAP** to show which features contributed to an anomaly decision.

### 3. 🔐 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

- **ML-KEM:** Used for post-quantum secure key establishment.
- **ML-DSA:** Used for digital signatures on security decisions and audit records.
- Protects the integrity and authenticity of important security events.

> **ML-KEM → Secure Key Establishment → ML-DSA → Signed Security Decision → PostgreSQL Audit Record**

### 4. 📈 Interactive Ablation Simulator

- React dashboard for multi-cycle attack simulations.
- Supports scenarios such as **Massive Exfiltration** and **Stealth Evasion**.
- Visualizes **AAS, RES, attacker adaptation, and defense response**.
- Compares static detection with the adaptive game-theoretic approach.

**ML-DSA**
- Used for digital signatures.
- Signs security decisions and audit records.
- Allows the system to verify that records have not been modified after signing.

## 🎮 Stackelberg Research Metrics

| Metric | Range | Description | Game Theory Role |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **AAS** | `-1.0` to `1.0` | **Attacker Adaptation Score:** Measures how much the attacker's strategy changes. | Helps identify strategy changes such as **Aggressive → Stealth** behavior. |
| **RES** | `-1.0` to `1.0` | **Response Effectiveness:** Measures how well the SOC's previous action handled the current threat. | Helps determine whether actions such as **Revoke** or **Restrict** were effective. |
